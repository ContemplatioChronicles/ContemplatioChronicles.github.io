Its 3 a.m. and i lie awake.\\
Past and future trap me in the present.\\
Stationary, unmoving, with no spark.\\
I stare at the milky, white crescent\\
It turns blood-red and dark.\\
The moon turns black, red fills the sky\\
Like a kaliedoscope with red-tinte glass\\
The last hour of the morning, doesn't seem the last\\
Prey eats predator, mice chase cats\\
Zombies hunting brains roam around\\
The chaos is profound\\
A thin needle stabs my heart\\
Until a thousand pouring holes made\\
Breathing and placed in a casket\\
Memories of me left to fade\\
A scene so vivid it makes me sick\\
The disgusting metallic taste of blood\\
As I cough up pools and drown\\
"Save me! I'd swim if i could."\\
Slits on my wrist imagined\\
As the past still daunts me\\
I open my book\\
My only companion in this night so ghastly.\\
A ray of hope shines through these books\\
Turning red to white\\
My future turns brighter as I complete chapters\\
And in the end I will sore high.
