Snowflakes on her palms,\\
As her body turns colder.\\
The snow matches her pale skin.\\
How much she'd wished to get older!

Time's stationary now.\\
Just like her unmoving body\\
But her soul wanders around,\\
Feeling extremely sorry.

Death seemed attractive\\
An escape so easy and quick.\\
But it lead her to a trap so ghastly,\\
That now it makes her sick.

Chemicals rushing through her body,\\
Shutting her organs down.\\
The deep cuts on her wrist,\\
The blood pools in which she drowns.

She found peace in pain\\
So she made cuts of different shapes.\\
Fractals of slits on her body,\\
Until the cuts reached her nape.

She didn't deserve this life.\\
She didn't deserve this death.\\
She always tried to make everything right.\\
Unfair was the fate she met.

I gave her lungs to a patient\\
But her limbs were too bruised to be used.\\
I kept her heart to myself,\\
Her heart and my heart infused.

Everyone loved her except herself\\
"Was is worth it?", I wonder\\
She failed in the game of life\\
Creating a big blunder.

So now her soul wanders\\
Never leaving my thoughts.\\
And she will stay for a million years\\
Trying to connect the dots.
